# socialbook

A sample AngularJS application for a job interview.

## Installation

This project requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Bower](http://bower.io) to install the required libraries and frameworks and to run the unit tests.
In order to run tha application you'll need to have a local web server. [Live-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), a light-weight NodeJS http server
 will do the trick. After making sure NodeJS, Bower and Live-Server are installed:
 
 ```
 
     $ git clone https://github.com/jvnicholson/socialbook.git
     $ cd socialbook
     $ npm install
     $ bower install
     $ live-server
 ```
 
 ## Testing
 
 To run the unit tests type `gulp test` from the root (i.e., 'socialbook') directory
